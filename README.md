# Hello 👋, I'm Linus
Student of Software Development at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/) — part of a global education movement that aims to revolutionize (tech) education.

Coming from a background in Humanities, my passion for coding and analytical thinking reignited in Statistics and data analysis using R/RStudio. The curriculum at 42 gave me the chance to take a deep dive into the realm of software development.
