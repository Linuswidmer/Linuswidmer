# Hello üëã, I'm Linus

I'm a software engineer with an academic background in psychology. \
The curriculum at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de/) fully ignited my passion for coding and analytical problem solving and ever since I've been striving to learn more üöÄ.
I seek to combine the best of both of my worlds and bring my expertise of collaboration and working with people into the realm of software development to create a brighter tomorrow (and today ‚òÄÔ∏è). \
Have a look at my previous and upcoming projects!
